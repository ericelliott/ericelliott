# 👋 Hi, I'm Eric Elliott

Webby-nominated software engineering expert, author, and creator of **SudoLang**, an AI programming language.

With over 10 years of experience deploying AI models at scale to millions of users, I've built and trained production AI models, and was an early pioneer of prompt engineering and **AI Driven Development (AIDD)**. I build systems where AI and human creativity meet.
